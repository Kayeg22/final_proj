    "text": "Boundaries and Settler Encroachment\nBoundaries can be described as “the imaginary, geographical places where assertions of property or sovereignty begin and end, made by practices of marking them on trees or measuring them with survey instruments or reminding one another that the line marks a division between at least two different places.”3\nSince the seventeenth century, acts of violence against the Indigenous people of this land have been waged. The forced removal and relegation of Indigenous people to reservations in the nineteenth century were acts of organized violence by settler-colonial institutions. The actions taken by the Federal Government are indicative of an attempt to assert its’ sovereignty and deny the same ability to the thousands of Indigenous people that were forced to leave their ancestral lands.\n\nReferences"

    "text": "Indigenous Students at Hampton Institute\nThere were Indigenous students from over 65 different nations at Hampton Institute. The largest population of students affiliated themselves with the Oneida, Lakota, Dakota, and Eastern Band Cherokee. As stated on other parts of this website, Indigenous cultures did not organize space or their world in the same way that Europeans did. However, as the ones in positions of power, white settlers carved out these states to suit their own needs, disregarding traditional knowledge surrounding the land itself.\nIt is important to note that the Lakota cared for the land in what is now Wyoming, Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Montana. However, in 1876, the Black Hills were taken by the Federal government, forcing the Lakota onto limited reservations in South Dakota and Northern North Dakota. Data for students can be located in footnote 3. Any data that is misrepresented or inaccurate is not intentional.\n\n\n\nGeneral Area of Occupation of Indigenous Students of Hampton\n\n\n\nReferences"
